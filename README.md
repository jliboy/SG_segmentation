# SG_segmentation
# These pipelines have been developed to segment granules in U-2OS cells by fluorescence microscopy. 


#G3BP_granules.cpproj is a CellProfiler pipeline designed for the segmentation on single cells and stress granules from live-cell fluorescence imaging.
#This pipeline takes TIF images that correspond to the field of view (position on the sample), time (timepoint in the original stack series), and channeles (e.g. GFP and mCherry) aquired on the microscopy experiment.
