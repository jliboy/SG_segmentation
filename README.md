# SG_segmentation
# These pipelines have been developed to segment granules in U-2OS cells imaged by fluorescence microscopy. 


G3BP_granules.cpproj is a CellProfiler pipeline designed for the segmentation of single cells and stress granules from live-cell fluorescence imaging.
This pipeline takes TIF images that correspond to the field of view (position on the sample), time (timepoint in the original stack series), and channels (e.g. GFP and mCherry) aquired on the microscopy experiment. 

IF_PAPB_SGs.cpproj is a CellProfiler pipeline designed for the segmentation of single cells and stress granules from an immnufluorescence experiment. 
This pipeline takes TIF images that correspond to the field of view (position on the sample), and channels (e.g. DAPI and GFP) aquired on the microscopy experiment.
